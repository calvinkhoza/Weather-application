# Real-Time Weather Dashboard

## Overview
This project aims to create a Real-Time Weather Dashboard that displays current weather conditions for a given location. 
The dashboard updates every minute with new data, providing users with accurate and up-to-date weather information. The project 
is divided into DevOps and Data Engineering tasks, with a focus on building a scalable, reliable, and efficient system 
for real-time data processing and visualization.

## Why This Project?
This project demonstrates the end-to-end implementation of a real-time data pipeline, from ingestion to visualization. It highlights
the use of modern big data tools and technologies to build a scalable and efficient system. The project is a great way to gain hands-on 
experience with:
- Real-time data streaming and processing.
- Distributed databases and data storage.
- Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- Containerization, CI/CD, and cloud-native deployment.

## Key Features
**Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Weather data is ingested in real-time from the OpenWeatherMap public API **Apache Kafka**.
**Data Processing**: The ingested data is processed using **Apache Spark** to extract relevant information.

## DevOps Tasks : [Calvin](https://github.com/calvinkhoza)


1. **Containerize the Application**: Using Docker to containerize the dashboard application.
2. **Create a CI/CD Pipeline**: Using GitLab CI/CD to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
3. **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Deploying the containerized application to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Data Engineering Tasks : [Lindelani](https://github.com/Lindelani21)


1. **Data Ingestion**: Using Apache Kafka to ingest real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap public API.
2. **Data Processing**: Using Apache Spark to process the ingested data and extract relevant information.
3. **Data Storage**: Using Apache Cassandra to store the processed data.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple locations and historical weather data analysis.
- Implement machine learning models to predict weather trends.
- Integrate alerts for extreme weather conditions.
